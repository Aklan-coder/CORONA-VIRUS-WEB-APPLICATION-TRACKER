##COVID-19 Web Application Tracking System Documentation

##Overview
The COVID-19 Web Application Tracking System is a data-driven solution designed to track and visualize COVID-19 data, providing insights into the spread of the virus. Developed using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, this application demonstrates the ability to design and implement a scalable and efficient tracking system.
Technical Specifications

Programming Language: Java 8
Framework: Spring Boot 2.7.2
Database: MySQL 8.0
Tools: Spring Data JPA, Maven, Git
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional)

##System Essence
T
he COVID-19 Web Application Tracking System is designed to:
Track Cases: Record and manage COVID-19 cases, including patient information, location, and status.
Visualize Data: Provide interactive dashboards and charts to visualize case data, including geographic distribution, trend analysis, and demographics.
Monitor Hotspots: Identify and highlight high-risk areas with increased case activity.
Predictive Analytics: Utilize machine learning algorithms to forecast case trends and predict potential hotspots.
Reporting: Generate detailed reports on case data, including statistics and visualizations.

##Database Schema
The database schema consists of the following entities:
Cases: Patient information, location, and status.
Locations: Geographic locations, including countries, regions, and cities.
Stats: Aggregated case data, including totals, averages, and trends.
Predictions: Forecasted case data and potential hotspots.

##API Endpoints
The application exposes the following API endpoints:
/cases: Retrieve a list of cases or create a new case.
/locations: Retrieve a list of locations or create a new location.
/stats: Retrieve aggregated case data and statistics.
/predictions: Retrieve forecasted case data and potential hotspots.
/reports: Generate detailed reports on case data.

##Security
Spring Security ensures secure authentication and authorization for the application. Role-based access control is implemented to restrict access to certain features and data.
Frontend Integration
The frontend developer can integrate the backend solution by calling the exposed API endpoints using HTTP requests. For example, to retrieve a list of cases, the frontend can send a GET request to /cases.
Usefulness
The COVID-19 Web Application Tracking System provides a valuable tool for tracking and visualizing COVID-19 data, enabling:
Data-Driven Decision Making: Inform public health policy and resource allocation.
Identifying Hotspots: Target high-risk areas with increased case activity.
Predictive Analytics: Forecast case trends and predict potential hotspots.
Transparency and Accountability: Provide detailed reports and visualizations for the public and stakeholders.
By following this documentation, developers can understand the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Web Application Tracking System, demonstrating the ability to design data-driven
